# Webscraping_AHRQ_Online_Database

This is part of AHRQ's Bringing Predictive Analytics to Healthcare Challenge. It contains Python API codes to extract hospital statistics from AHRQ's online database. The code extracts California's hospital data from 2011-2015 on county level. It can be easily adapted to extract data for all US states.
